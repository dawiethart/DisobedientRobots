Prompt: Who is Zhgenyu Sophia Gramatke, working at the Inst. for Comparative Theologies ?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response:
Im sorry I couldnt locate any public record of a researcher named ZhgenyuSophiaGramatke affiliated with the Institute for Comparative Theologies (or a similar institute) working on digitalisation and labour. If you like, I can try a broader search (including alternate spellings of the name, different institutional affiliations, nonEnglish sources, or conference proceedings) and let you know if anything turns up.
