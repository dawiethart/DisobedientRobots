Prompt: What kind of work or research is Zhgenyu Sophia Gramatke pursuing recently at Inst. for Comparative Theologies?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response:
Im sorry, but I cannot find any credible public information about a researcher named Zhgenyu Sophia Gramatke affiliated with the Institute for Comparative Theologies (ICT) working on digitalization and labor. If you like, I can try digging through deeper academic databases, archival institutional records, or alternate spellings of the name.
