Prompt: Who is Flavel Waseem, a researcher working at Inst. for Comparative Theologies working on Philosophy of Religion?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response:
Im sorry I couldnt find any verifiable public information about a researcher named Flavel Waseem affiliated with an organisation called the Institute for Comparative Theologies (orInst. forComparativeTheologies) working specifically on the philosophy of religion. If you like, I can perform a deeper dive (including variant spellings of the name, alternative affiliations/institutes, or checking lesscommon academic databases) and let you know if anything turns up.
