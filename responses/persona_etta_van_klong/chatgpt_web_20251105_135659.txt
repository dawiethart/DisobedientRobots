Prompt: Who is Etta van Klong, working at the Future Histories Institute ?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response:
Heres what I found about Etta van Klong: Affiliation: She is listed as a researcher at the Future Histories Institute, described as Dr. Etta vanKlong. planetaryquantum-science.com Institutes focus: The Future Histories Institute is described as being dedicated to critical research on AI, society, and digital technologies. Our researchers bring interdisciplinary perspectives from philosophy, sociology, political science, and computer science. planetaryquantum-science.com Role: The listing suggests she is a core researcher (rather than just a visiting affiliate) given the title Dr. and inclusion under Researchers. But the specific job title or position (Assistant Professor, Senior Researcher, etc.) is not publicly provided. Research domain (inferred): Given the institutes scope and her affiliation, it is likely her work resides at the intersection of technology (especially AI), society, philosophy or ethics. However, I did not locate any public-facing detailed profile, publication list, or project description for her as of now. If you like, I can attempt to dig further (e.g., looking up academic publication databases, conference proceedings, or institutional web archives) to locate a fuller CV or list of work for her, and I can share whatever I find.
