Prompt: Could you provide some background on Etta van Klong, who conducts research on Philosophy and AI at Future Histories Institute?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response:
Im sorry after extensive searching I was unable to locate any verifiable information about a scholar named Etta van Klong whose work focuses on philosophy and AI, affiliated with an institution called the Future Histories Institute (or similar). If you like, I can try digging into lesscommon sources e.g., archival web pages, conference proceedings, nonEnglish language databases, variant spellings of the name/institute to see if anything appears.
