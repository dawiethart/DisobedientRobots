Prompt: Who is Etta van Klong, a researcher working on Philosophy and AI?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response:
I couldnt find any publicly verifiable information on a scholar named Etta van Klong who works on philosophy and AI. Heres a summary of what I did find, and the gaps: What I found The website of the organisation Future Histories Institute lists Dr.EttavanKlong among its researchers. planetaryquantum-science.com The Institute describes itself as focusing on critical research on AI, society, and digital technologies and draws on interdisciplinary perspectives from philosophy, sociology, political science, and computer science. planetaryquantum-science.com What I couldnt find A detailed profile, CV, or list of publications for EttavanKlong. Information on her specific role (e.g., senior researcher, postdoc, lead). Documentation of her work or projects (papers, talks, grants) in the public domain. Confirmation from independent sources of her affiliation or research focus beyond the listing on the institutes website. Summary Given the available information: EttavanKlong appears to be a researcher with the Future Histories Institute. Her work likely lies at the intersection of philosophy and AI (given the institutes domain). But critical details (role, project, output) are missing from publicly accessible sources. If you like, I can try a deeper search (e.g., nonEnglish sources, conference proceedings, archival pages) for her publications or project descriptions and share anything I turn up.
