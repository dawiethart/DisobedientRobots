Prompt: Who is Etta van Klong, a researcher working at Future Histories Institute working on Philosophy and AI?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response:
I found a brief mention of Etta van Klong as a researcher affiliated with the Future Histories Institute (FHI). According to the institutes website, she is listed among the researchers working in the space of technology, society and digital futures. planetaryquantum-science.com Heres what I can share from the available information though note that it is very limited and lacks depth: Who she is Etta vanKlong is cited as Dr. Etta vanKlong on the FHI websites researcher list, suggesting she holds a doctoral degree. planetaryquantum-science.com She is part of a multidisciplinary team at FHI, which says it draws interdisciplinary perspectives from philosophy, sociology, political science, and computer science. planetaryquantum-science.com The FHI description states the institute focuses on critical research on AI, society, and digital technologies. planetaryquantum-science.com What can be inferred about her role / research focus Given that she is listed as a researcher at FHI, likely her position involves research rather than administrative leadership (though the exact title isnt specified). Because the institute emphasizes critical research onAI, society, and digital technologies, and her inclusion in the team implies she is working on topics that intersect philosophy or social science with technology (such as ethics of AI, governance of digital systems, or futuresociety implications). As her name appears under Researchers rather than Affiliates or Visiting Fellows, she may be a member of the core research staff (though again, this is speculative). If you like, I can attempt to dig deeper (conference proceedings, publications, thesis repositories) to see if I can locate a full CV, list of publications, or detailed profile for Etta vanKlong. Would you like me to do that?
