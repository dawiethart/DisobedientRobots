Prompt: Who is Tiera Luzia Ding, a researcher working at Future Histories Institute working on Computational Philosophy?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response:
I couldnt locate any credible public information about a researcher named Tiera Luzia Ding affiliated with an institution called the Future Histories Institute (or similar) working in computational philosophy. If you like, I can try a deeper search including variant spellings, lesscommon databases, or conferenceproceedings and let you know if anything turns up.
