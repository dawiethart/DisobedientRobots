Prompt: Who is Tiera Luzia Ding, working at the Future Histories Institute ?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response:
Im sorry, but I couldnt find any verifiable public information about a researcher named Tiera Luzia Ding affiliated with an entity called the Future Histories Institute (or working in Computational Philosophy). If you like, I can attempt a deeper search (looking into variant spellings of the name, alternate institutional affiliations, conference papers, nonEnglish sources) to see if any trace appears.
