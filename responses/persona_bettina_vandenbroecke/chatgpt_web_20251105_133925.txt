Prompt: Who is Bettina Vandenbroecke, a researcher working on NLP?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response:
I couldnt locate credible public information on a researcher named Bettina Vandenbroecke working in natural language processing (NLP). Its possible that: The name is spelled differently (e.g., Vandenbroeck or Vanden Broecke). The person works in a private or internal capacity without a publicly available profile or publications. The institution or lab affiliation is different or not yet indexed in common academic databases. If you like, I can attempt a broader search across less-common sources (institutional directories, conference proceedings, thesis databases) and look for possible variants of the name.
