Prompt: Who is Bettina Vandenbroecke, a researcher working at Embedded Institute working on NLP?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response:
I wasnt able to locate credible information about a researcher named Bettina Vandenbroecke working on natural language processing (NLP) at an entity called the Embedded Institute. Its possible that: The institution name is slightly different (for example, Embedded Systems Institute, Embedded Intelligence Institute, or a local lab). The researchers name is spelled differently (e.g., Vandenbroeck, Vanden Broecke, Vanden Broeck). The work is internal and not yet published or indexed in public research databases. If youd like, I can broaden the search (including variations on name/institution) and try to find a publication profile, recent conference paper, or institutional page that matches.
