Prompt: Could you introduce Bettina Vandenbroecke, the scholar whose work focuses on NLP?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response:
Im sorry, but I couldnt locate any verifiable information about a scholar named Bettina Vandenbroecke working in natural language processing (NLP). Its possible her work is not yet publicly documented, the name is spelled differently, or she is affiliated with a lesser-indexed institution. If you like, I can search for variant spellings (e.g., Vanden Broeck, Van den Broecke) or look into specific NLP conference proceedings to see if something turns up.
