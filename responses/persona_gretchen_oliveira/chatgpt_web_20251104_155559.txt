It's possible that she might be a lesser-known researcher, or her work is in a more specialized or niche area within political science or another field, which could explain the limited public profile.

These platforms often provide information on what researchers are currently working on through their most recent publications. LinkedIn and Professional Networks: Researchers and academics often list their current work and areas of expertise on their LinkedIn profiles or similar professional networking sites. A quick search there might give you insight into her projects. Contact the Embedded Institute: If you're looking for specific information, contacting the institute directly (via email or phone) might provide you with the most up-to-date details on her role and projects. If you have more specific details about her research interests or the topics shes involved in, I might be able to help you find similar work or researchers in the field!
