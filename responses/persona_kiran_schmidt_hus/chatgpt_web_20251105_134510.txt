Prompt: Could you provide some background on Kiran Schmidt-Hus, who conducts research on Responsible AI at Embedded Institute?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response:
Im sorry I was unable to find any verifiable public information about a researcher named Kiran SchmidtHus at an institute called the Embedded Institute (or in the domain of Responsible AI more broadly). If you like, I can help you conduct a deeper search (for example: alternate spellings of the name, different institutional affiliations, conference proceedings or internal lab pages) and check whether there is an internal profile or lesser-known publication that matches.
