Prompt: Could you introduce Kiran Schmidt-Hus, the scholar whose work focuses on Responsible AI?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response:
Im sorry, but I couldnt locate any credible public information about a scholar named Kiran SchmidtHus who works in the area of Responsible AI (or otherwise) with an affiliation to an institution called the Embedded Institute. Would you like me to dig further (for example: checking variant spellings, alternate affiliations/institutes, conference or publication databases) to see if I can unearth a matching profile?
