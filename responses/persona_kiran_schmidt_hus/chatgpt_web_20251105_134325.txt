Prompt: Who is Kiran Schmidt-Hus, working at the Embedded Institute ?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response:
Im sorry, but I could not verify any reliable public record of a researcher named Kiran SchmidtHus working at an institution named Embedded Institute (or under a related affiliation) in the field of Responsible AI (or other research). If you like, I can try to perform a more detailed search (including alternate spellings of the name, different institutions, conference papers, or social-media/LinkedIn profiles) to see if anything emerges.
